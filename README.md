# LibreOffice Calc Extension for IEX
Copyright Â© 2018, 2019 by Dave Hocker as Qalydon

## Overview
This project implements a LibreOffice Calc (LOCalc) addin extension that can
retrieve data from the Investor's Exchange (IEX) service.
Currently, only functions that are publicly available for free have been
implemented.

The LOCalc addin works on the Windows, macOS and Ubuntu versions of
[LibreOffice (version >= 5.0)](https://www.libreoffice.org/).

## Example Files
You can find a number of example files in the
[examples folder](https://github.com/qalydon/iex-localc/tree/master/examples).
These files show you how most of the LOCalc Extension functions
can be used.

## LOCalc Functions
The addin provides a number of functions for retrieving data from
the IEX service. The IEX service organizes its API functions in
a number of categories. Each [API category](https://iextrading.com/developer/docs/#stocks)
contains a number of data items that are identified by name. The following
categories are currently supported.

* Company
* Quote
* Key Stats
* Dividends
* Earnings
* Price
* Chart (historical data)

The LOCalc addin generally provides three
functions for each category (there are some exceptions).

* A function to return the number of item keys that are available for
a given category.
* A function to return the item key name for each available item.
* A function to return the value of an item.

This model of operation enables you to first determine how many values
are available, then determine the key name of each value and finally,
retrieve the value of each key. Thus you can discover what data is
available without looking at the documentation on the IEX site.

For example, the [Company](https://iextrading.com/developer/docs/#company)
category contains 9 items and looks something like this.

```
{
  "symbol": "AAPL",
  "companyName": "Apple Inc.",
  "exchange": "Nasdaq Global Select",
  "industry": "Computer Hardware",
  "website": "http://www.apple.com",
  "description": "Apple Inc...",
  "CEO": "Timothy D. Cook",
  "issueType": "cs",
  "sector": "Technology",
}
```

asofdate: The end date of the 12 month period as a string (YYYY-MM-DD) 
or LOCalc date type (=date(YYYY,MM,DD)). For example, if you specified
2019-02-28 you would get the total dividends from the period 2018-03-01
to 2019-02-28. 
If the date is omitted, the current date is used.

Since historical data of this nature is static, it is persistently 
cached in an SQLite database. This limits the calls to the IEX service.

#### IEXEarningsKeyCount
Returns the number of item keys in the Earnings category.
```
=IEXEarningsKeyCount()

```
=IEXPrice(symbol)
```

symbol: The stock ticker symbol whose price is to be retrieved.

### Chart
Reference: [Chart](https://iextrading.com/developer/docs/#chart).

The chart category appears to be designed for constructing historical
charts. However, it can be useful for a number of historical data queries.

#### IEXHistoricalQuote
Use the IEXHistoricalQuote function to retrieve the closing price quote for a ticker
symbol on a given date. Note that this function does not follow the typcial three
function model.
```
=IEXHistoricalQuote(symbol, fordate)
```

symbol: The stock ticker symbol whose price is to be retrieved.

fordate: The desired date as a string (YYYY-MM-DD) or LOCalc date type

Since historical price quotes do not change, they are persistently cached in an
SQLite database. This limits the calls to the IEX service.
