Copyright Â© 2018 by Dave Hocker as Qalydon

## Overview
This project implements a LibreOffice Calc (LOCalc) addin extension that can
retrieve data from the Investor's Exchange (IEX) service.
Currently, only functions that are publicly available for free have been
implemented.

The LOCalc addin works on the Windows, macOS and Ubuntu versions of
[LibreOffice (version >= 5.0)](https://www.libreoffice.org/).

## Example Files
You can find a number of example files in the
[examples folder](https://github.com/qalydon/iex-localc/tree/master/examples).
These files show you how most of the LOCalc Extension functions
can be used.

## LOCalc Functions
The addin provides a number of functions for retrieving data from
the IEX service. The IEX service organizes its API functions in
a number of categories. Each [API category](https://iextrading.com/developer/docs/#stocks)
contains a number of data items that are identified by name. The following
categories are supported.

* Company
* Quote
* Key Stats
* Price

The LOCalc addin generally provides three
functions for each category (there are some exceptions).

* A function to return the number of item keys that are available for
a given category.
* A function to return the item key name for each available item.
* A function to return the value of an item.

This model of operation enables you to first determine how many values
are available, then determine the key name of each value and finally,
retrieve the value of each key. Thus you can discover what data is
available without looking at the documentation on the IEX site.

For example, the [Company](https://iextrading.com/developer/docs/#company)
category contains 9 items and looks something like this.

```
{
  "symbol": "AAPL",
  "companyName": "Apple Inc.",
  "exchange": "Nasdaq Global Select",
  "industry": "Computer Hardware",
  "website": "http://www.apple.com",
  "description": "Apple Inc...",
  "CEO": "Timothy D. Cook",
  "issueType": "cs",
  "sector": "Technology",
}
```
